We employ a suite of smoothed-particle-hydrodynamic simulations to study the formation and evolution of gaseous structures around a MBHB constantly perturbed by the incoherent infall of molecular clouds.
We focus on the dynamical response of the binary orbit to different levels of anisotropy of the incoherent accretion events.
We also investigate the influence of the infall rate and angular momentum distribution of the clouds on the geometry and stability of the arising structures.
